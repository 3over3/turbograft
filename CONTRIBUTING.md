# PR Guidelines

* Make each pull request atomic and exclusive; don't send pull requests for a laundry list of changes.
* Even better, commit in small manageable chunks.
* Make sure there are tests associated with your PR such that they fail without the code you've
    added
* Label your PR with one of `Major Release`, `Minor Release` or `Patch Release` as outlined at
    <http://semver.org>.
* Tag a few [contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for review
