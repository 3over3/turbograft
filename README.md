# TurboGraft

It's like turbolinks, but with partial page replacement and tests

`Graft` - (noun) a shoot or twig inserted into a slit on the trunk or stem of a living plant, from which it receives sap.

In botony, one can take parts of a tree and splice it onto another tree.  The DOM is a tree.  In this library, we're cutting off sub-trees of the DOM and splicing new ones on.
